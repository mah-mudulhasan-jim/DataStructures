One of the very fundamental and must learn things in Computer Science is Data Structures. It basically gives the idea how to get the datas structured in proper rules. 

This project basically contains the basic Data Structures taught in BRAC University.
Here the problems and coding solutions are given.
One can easily go through the problems and solutions for batter understanding in Data Structures. Hope the Project won't make you bored. Best of luck...
